      # this {#require} method is only re-defined on a Resolver object and thus
      # will not hurt performance - it will only be called for a few times (most
      # likely once), this should still be fine for AR < 3.2 where this patch
      # ends up on `class << ActiveRecord::Base` since models usually rely on
      # Rails's auto-loading of (missing) constants and rarely use `require`.
      #
      # other alternative (to make sure we do not need to eager load AR built-in
      #  adapters) would be to mingle with the $LOAD_PATH which seems worse ...
