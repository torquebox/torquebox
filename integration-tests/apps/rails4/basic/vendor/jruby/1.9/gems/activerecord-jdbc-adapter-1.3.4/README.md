# ActiveRecord JDBC Adapter

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/activerecord-jdbc-adapter.png)][7]

ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter (AR-JDBC) is a database adapter for Rails'
*ActiveRecord* component that can be used with [JRuby][0]. It allows use of
virtually any JDBC-compliant database with your JRuby on Rails application.

We supports *ActiveRecord* **2.3**, **3.x** and **4.x** from a single code base.
You'll need JRuby >= **1.6.8** (we recommend using the latest and greatest of
JRubies) thus Java >= **1.6** is mandatory.

#### AR-JDBC **1.3.x** is a recommended update for all **1.2.x** users.

Our latest major version **1.3.x** represents a few months of refactoring and
updates covering (not just) new/old *ActiveRecord* features. It tries to stay
compatible with 1.2.9 as much as possible but please be aware that it's not always
possible(mostly for the best), please read our [migration guide][8] for details.

## Databases

ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter provides full or nearly full support for:
**MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLite3**, **Oracle**, *MS-SQL** (SQL Server),
**DB2**, **Firebird**, **Derby**, **HSQLDB**, **H2**, and **Informix**.

Other databases will require testing and likely a custom configuration module.
Please join the JRuby [mailing list][1] to help us discover support for more
databases.

## Using ActiveRecord JDBC

### Inside Rails

To use AR-JDBC with JRuby on Rails:

1. Choose the adapter you wish to gem install. The following pre-packaged
adapters are available:

  - Base JDBC (`activerecord-jdbc-adapter`) - supports all available databases
    via JDBC, but requires you to download and manually setup a JDBC driver for
    the database you're using
  - MySQL (`activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter`)
  - PostgreSQL (`activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter`)
  - SQLite3 (`activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter`)
  - Derby (`activerecord-jdbcderby-adapter`)
  - HSQLDB (`activerecord-jdbchsqldb-adapter`)
  - H2 (`activerecord-jdbch2-adapter`)
  - MSSQL (`activerecord-jdbcmssql-adapter`) - uses the OSS jTDS driver by default
    which might have issues with the latest SQLServer (but should work using the
    Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server - we recommend using 4.0)

2a. If you're generating a new Rails application, use the following command:

    jruby -S rails new sweetapp

2b. Otherwise, you might need to perform some extra configuration steps
to prepare your Rails application for JDBC.

You'll need to modify your *Gemfile* to use the *activerecord-jdbc-adapter* gem
(or one of the helper gems) under JRuby. Change your *Gemfile* to look something
like the following:

```ruby
gem 'mysql2', platform: :ruby
gem 'activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter', platform: :jruby
```

If you're (stuck) using Rails 2.3, you might need to:

    jruby script/generate jdbc

3. Configure your *database.yml* in the normal Rails style:

```yml
development:
  adapter: mysql2 # or mysql
  database: blog_development
  username: blog
  password: 1234
```

**Legacy Configuration:** If you use one of the *activerecord-jdbcxxx-adapter*
gems, you can still put a 'jdbc' prefix in front of the database adapter name,
e.g. `adapter: jdbcmysql`.

For plain JDBC database configurations, you'll need to know the database driver
class and URL (do not forget to put the driver .jar(s) on the class-path) e.g.:

```yml
development:
  adapter: jdbc
  username: blog
  password: 1234
  driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog_development
```

For JNDI data sources, you may simply specify the JNDI location as follows (the
correct database type will be automatically detected):

```yml
production:
  adapter: jndi # jdbc
  jndi: jdbc/PostgreDS
```

JDBC driver specific properties might be set if you use an URL to specify the DB
or preferably using the *properties:* syntax:

```yml
production:
  adapter: mysql
  username: blog
  password: blog
  url: "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog?profileSQL=true"
  properties: # specific to com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    socketTimeout:  60000
    connectTimeout: 60000
```

If you're really old school you might want to use AR-JDBC with a DB2 on z/OS:

```yml
development:
  adapter: jdbc
  url: jdbc:db2j:net://mightyzoshost:446/RAILS_DBT1
  driver: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
  schema: DB2XB12
  database: RAILS_DB1
  tablespace: TSDE911
  lob_tablespaces:
    first_table: TSDE912
  username: business
  password: machines
  encoding: unicode
  # you can force a (DB2) dialect using:
  #dialect: as400
```

More information on (configuring) AR-JDBC might be found on our [wiki][5].

### Standalone with ActiveRecord

Once the setup is made (see below) you can establish a JDBC connection like this
(e.g. for `activerecord-jdbcderby-adapter`):

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  adapter: 'derby',
  database: 'db/my-database'
)
```

or using (requires that you manually put the driver jar on the class-path):

```ruby
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => 'jdbc',
  :driver => 'org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver',
  :url => 'jdbc:derby:sample_db;create=true'
)
```

#### Using Bundler

Proceed as with Rails; specify `ActiveRecord` in your Bundle along with the
chosen JDBC adapter(s), this time sample *Gemfile* for MySQL:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord', '~> 3.2.14'
gem 'activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter', :platform => :jruby
```

When you `require 'bundler/setup'` everything will be set up for you as expected.

You do not need to use the 'helper' *activerecord-jdbcxxx-adapter* gem we provide
but than should make sure an appropriate JDBC driver is available at runtime, in
that case simply setup your *Gemfile* as:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord', '~> 4.0.0'
gem 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter', '~> 1.3.2', platform: :jruby
```

#### Without Bundler

Install the needed gems with JRuby, for example:

    gem install activerecord -v "~> 3.2.10"
    gem install activerecord-jdbc-adapter --ignore-dependencies

If you wish to use the adapter for a specific database, you can install it
directly and the (jdbc-) driver gem (dependency) will be installed as well:

    jruby -S gem install activerecord-jdbcderby-adapter

Your program should include:

```ruby
require 'active_record'
require 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter' if defined? JRUBY_VERSION
# or in case you're using the pre-packaged adapter gem :
require 'activerecord-jdbcderby-adapter' if defined? JRUBY_VERSION
```

## Extending AR-JDBC

You can create your own extension to AR-JDBC for a JDBC-based database that core
AR-JDBC does not support. We've created an example project for the Intersystems
Cache database that you can examine as a template.
See the [cachedb-adapter project][4] for more information.

## Source

The source for activerecord-jdbc-adapter is available using git:

    git clone git://github.com/jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter.git

Please note that the project manages multiple gems from a single repository,
if you're using *Bundler* >= 1.2 it should be able to locate all gemspecs from
the git repository. Sample *Gemfile* for running with (MySQL) master:

```ruby
gem 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter', :github => 'jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter'
gem 'activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter', :github => 'jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter'
```
