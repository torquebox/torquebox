  <title>JBoss AS Crash Course</title>

  <para>The JBoss Application Server (AS7) is the foundation upon which
  TorqueBox is built. You can go a long way with TorqueBox without knowing
  anything about the administration of JBoss AS, but for advanced
  applications, it's worth knowing something about how AS is configured and
  extended. Feel free to skip this section if you're just getting started with
  TorqueBox, and use it as a reference later.</para>

  <section id="configuring-jboss">
    <title>Configuring</title>

    <para>JBoss folder structure now has expressive changes since previous
    releases, the most visible comes to folder structure and runtime modes:
    <emphasis role="bold">domain</emphasis> and <emphasis
    role="bold">standalone<emphasis>. In this release of Torquebox, just
    standalone mode is available, domain mode support will come to the next
    releases.</emphasis></emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis>Now in JBoss,
    all server configuration profile is concentrated <emphasis>in</emphasis>
    <emphasis><filename>standalone/configuration</filename></emphasis><emphasis>
    path</emphasis> through </emphasis>standalone.xml<emphasis> file, making
    admin tasks more easier to maintenance.
    </emphasis></emphasis></emphasis></para>

                     format="PNG" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>TorqueBox uses default mode from standalone runtime. A stock JBoss
    distribution will come with others, as you see above, custom profiles will
    come up in the next releases.</para>

    <para>JBoss AS 7 comes with a modular architecture, libraries common to
    all server configurations are kept under the <filename>modules/</filename>
    directory and configuration files are stored inside
    <literal>standalone/configuration</literal>/ folder.</para>

    <para>All configuration profiles have a common structure, and usually
    include the following directories: <filename>conf/</filename>,
    <filename>lib/</filename>, <filename>deployers/</filename>, and
    <filename>deploy/</filename>. In general, it isn't a good idea to remove
    anything from these directories that you didn't put there yourself.</para>

    <para><mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/jboss-default.png"
                     format="PNG" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>In addition, some directories are created automatically at runtime,
    as needed: <filename>tmp/</filename>, <filename>work/</filename>,
    <filename>data/</filename>, and <filename>log/</filename>. Though not
    typically necessary, you may safely delete these when the server is not
    running to clear its persistent state.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="running-jboss">
    <title>Running</title>

    <para>The <filename>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</filename> directory contains the
    main JBoss entry point, <filename>standalone.sh</filename> (or
    <filename>standalone.bat</filename>), along with its config file,
    <filename>standalone.conf</filename>. Running the JBoss server is simple:
    <screen> <prompt>$</prompt> <command>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh</command> </screen></para>

    <para>Permanent runtime configuration of JBoss should go in
    <filename>bin/standalone.conf</filename>. For example, your application
    may require more memory (RAM) than the default allocated. Edit
    <filename>standalone.conf</filename> to increase the value of
    <option>-Xmx</option> to something reasonable.</para>

    <para>Though <xref linkend="capistrano-support" /> doesn't strictly
    require it, in production you may prefer to control JBoss via a Unix "init
    script", examples of which may be found in <filename>bin/</filename>. Feel
    free to tweak one for your particular OS.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="deploying-to-jboss">
    <title>Deploying</title>

    <para>Each server configuration has a <filename>deploy/</filename>
    subdirectory, the contents of which determine the applications and
    services JBoss runs. These apps and services are represented as archives,
    "exploded" folders, or text files called "deployment descriptors". JBoss
    constantly monitors changes to this directory, hot-deploying an artifact
    when it's added, undeploying it when it's removed, and "bouncing"
    (redeploying) it when it's changed.</para>

    <para><mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/jboss-deploy.png"
                     format="PNG" scale="70" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>TorqueBox also provides an additional deploy directory at
    <filename>$TORQUEBOX_HOME/apps/</filename> that is scanned from all server
    configurations, and any deployment descriptors or archives found there are
    loaded after the <filename>deploy/</filename> directory within the server
    configuration. This prevents your application from being loaded before all
    of the JBoss components have been deployed, and segregates your
    applications from the JBoss plumbing.</para>

    <para>TorqueBox provides Rake tasks to create and copy a deployment
    descriptor for your Ruby application to
    <filename>$TORQUEBOX_HOME/apps/</filename>. For more details, see <xref
    linkend="deployment" /> and <xref
    linkend="deployment-descriptors" />.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jboss-logging">
    <title>Logging</title>

    <para>Each server configuration has a <filename>log/</filename>
    subdirectory (created at runtime, if necessary) that contains the log
    messages generated by JBoss as determined by its configuration.</para>

    <para>JBoss provides a very sophisticated logging system that nobody
    completely understands. Logging configuration rules are contained in
    <filename>deploy/jboss-logging.xml</filename>, in which may be found
    example configs for categorized log message routing, complex file
    rotation, syslog integration, SMTP notifications, SNMP traps, JMS, JMX and
    more! It is <emphasis>WAY</emphasis> beyond the scope of this document to
    explain those rules, but by default you will see INFO messages on the
    console (the shell where you start JBoss) and persistently written to
    <filename>log/server.log</filename>. You can control the log level easily
    using the following system property: <screen> <prompt>$</prompt> <command>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh -Djboss.server.log.threshold=DEBUG</command> </screen>
    Any messages written to <constant>stdout</constant> or
    <constant>stderr</constant> will also be displayed on the console and
    written to <filename>log/server.log</filename>.</para>

    <section id="torquebox-logger">
      <title>The <classname>TorqueBox::Logger</classname></title>

      <para>Ruby Loggers work normally inside of TorqueBox, of course, and
      you'll find your Rails log files exactly where you expect them to be.
      But some users, especially those already familiar with JBoss logging,
      may prefer for their Ruby log messages to be passed to JBoss. This is
      easily achieved using the <classname>TorqueBox::Logger</classname>,
      constructed with an optional "category". For example, you may configure
      your Rails app like so: <screen> <code>config.logger = TorqueBox::Logger.new</code> </screen>
      This results in all Rails-generated log messages passed to JBoss, hence
      written to <filename>log/server.log</filename> in the default
      configuration. The category for these messages will be the application's
      name. You can override this by passing the category name in the
      constructor: <screen> <code>TorqueBox::Logger.new( "Billing" )</code> </screen>
      You can also pass a class in the constructor, as is common in Java
      applications: <screen> <code>@logger = TorqueBox::Logger.new( self.class )</code> </screen>
      This allows you to be more strategic with your logging, sending some
      messages to the normal Rails logs and others to JBoss for more
      "enterprisey" processing.</para>
