        notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
        informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
        add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
        distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the

  reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  the conditions stated in this License.
  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">5. Submission of Contributions</emphasis>.
    Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
    intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the

    separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
    regarding such Contributions.

    ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
    any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

    no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
    negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable
    law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
    writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
    but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
    damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages.
  </para>
  <para>

    While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
    choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
    warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
    consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if
    You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
    for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
    Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
    additional liability.
