  <title>Ruby-on-Rails Support</title>

  <para>TorqueBox provides an enterprise-grade environment that not only
  provides complete Ruby-on-Rails compatibility, but also goes beyond the
  functionality offered in traditional Rails environments.</para>

  <section id="ruby-on-rails" revision="1">
    <title>Ruby-on-Rails</title>

    <para>Ruby-on-Rails (also referred to as "RoR" or "Rails") is one of the
    most popular Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks for the Ruby language.
    It was originally created by David Heinemeier Hansson at <ulink
    url="http://37signals.com/">37signals</ulink> during the course of
    building many actual Ruby applications for their consulting
    business.</para>

    <para>Rails has straight-forward components representing models, views,
    and controllers. The framework as a whole values convention over
    configuration. It has been described as "opinionated software" in that
    many decisions have been taken away from the end-user.</para>

    <para>It is exactly the opinionated nature of Rails that allows it to be
    considered a simple and agile framework for quickly building web-based
    applications. Additionally, since Ruby is an interpreted language instead
    of compiled, the assets of an application can be edited quickly, with the
    results being immediately available. In most cases, the application does
    not need to be restarted to see changes in models, views or controllers
    reflected.</para>

    <title>Rails on TorqueBox</title>

    <para>Since Ruby-on-Rails ostensibly doesn't do anything new, but simply
    does it with a different language, TorqueBox uses the power of <ulink
    url="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</ulink> to deploy regular Ruby-on-Rails apps
    within the JBoss AS appserver.</para>

    <para>Your Rails application gets deployed alongside any other WAR or EAR,

      <title>Freeze Rails</title>

      <para>Before a rails application can be deployed on the TorqueBox
      server, the Rails framework must be <emphasis>frozen</emphasis>.

      <title>Include the JDBC Gems for Database Connectivity</title>

      <para>ActiveRecord applications deployed on TorqueBox benefit from using
      the Java-based JDBC database drivers. These drivers are provided as a
      handful of gems which you may include into your application through
      <filename>config/environment.rb</filename>.</para>

      <para>JDBC gems for many popular databases is pre-installed with the
      TorqueBox server. You simply must reference the
      activerecord-jdbc-adapter from your <filename>environment.rb</filename>
      within the <code>Rails::Initializer.run</code> block.</para>

      <para><screen>Rails::Initializer.run do |config|

  config.gem "activerecord-jdbc-adapter",
             :lib=&gt;'jdbc_adapter'

end</screen></para>

      <para>All databases will require inclusion of the
      <filename>activerecord-jdbc-adapter</filename>. No other gems need to be
      required or loaded, since ActiveRecord will perform further discovery on
      its own. Database gems supporting Derby, H2, HSQLDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
      and SQLite3 are supplied in the TorqueBox binary distribution.</para>

      <title>Include the TorqueBox Ruby packages</title>

      <para>In order to gain access to the advanced features of TorqueBox, you

    <title>Deploying</title>

    <para>The TorqueBox Application Server is capable of serving many
    applications simultaneously. To add your application to the server, you
    must <emphasis>deploy</emphasis> it.</para>

    <section id="deploy-using-rake" revision="1">
      <title>Deploy using the Rake tasks</title>

      <para>The TorqueBox-Rails support package includes Rake tasks to deploy
      and undeploy your application from an instance of the TorqueBox
      Server.</para>

      <para>First, the variable <envar>$JBOSS_HOME</envar> must be set to the
      path of the top of your JBoss installation as described in <xref
      linkend="installation" /></para>

      <para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>export JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/torquebox/jboss</command></screen></para>

      <para>If you're using any configuration other than
      <classname>default</classname>, you must also set
      <envar>$JBOSS_CONF</envar>.</para>

      <para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>export JBOSS_CONF=web</command></screen></para>

      <para>Once these variables are set, you may perform a default deployment
      using the <command>jboss:rails:deploy</command> task.</para>

      <para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>rake torquebox:rails:deploy</command></screen></para>

      <para>To undeploy your application, the jboss:rails:undeploy task is
      available</para>

      <para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>rake torquebox:rails:undeploy</command></screen></para>

      <para>The TorqueBox Server does not need to be running for these
      commands to work.</para>

      <para>By default, these tasks deploy your application to root of your
      TorqueBox Server's web space, without any virtual host configuration. To
      access the application once deployed, you should use your browser to
      access <uri>http://localhost:8080/</uri>.</para>

      <para>When the application is deployed, a deployment descriptor is
      written to the
      <filename>$JBOSS_HOME/server/$JBOSS_CONF/deploy/</filename> directory
      with a filename based upon the directory name of your
      <filename>$RAILS_ROOT</filename>.</para>

      <para>For instance, if your application was deployed from
      /Users/bob/myapp/, the deployment descriptor would be named
      <filename>myapp-rails.yml</filename>.</para>

      <para>Rewriting or simply updating the last-modified time (using a
      command such as <command>touch</command>) of this descriptor will cause
      the TorqueBox server to redeploy the application. The
      <command>torquebox:rails:deploy</command> task simply emits this
      file.</para>

      <para>Removing the descriptor will cause the TorqueBox server to
      undeploy the application. This is what the
      <command>torquebox:rails:undeploy</command> task does.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deploy using a descriptor</title>

      <para>To customize some of the aspects of deployment, instead of using
      the Rake tasks, you may manually create a <emphasis>deployment
      descriptor</emphasis>. A deployment descriptor is a small text file that
      is placed in the <filename>deploy/</filename> directory of the server in
      order to have the application deployed.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Location &amp; Naming</title>

        <para>The deployment descriptor needs to be placed within the deploy/
        directory of the AS configuration in use. If you are using the default
        configuration, the path would be:</para>

        <para><screen><filename>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/</filename></screen></para>

        <para>The descriptor is a YAML file, and must end with the suffix of
        <filename>-rails.yml</filename>. The prefix is arbitrary, but is
        usually some form of your application's name.</para>

        <para><screen><filename>$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/<emphasis
                role="bold">myapp-rails.yml</emphasis></filename></screen></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Contents of the descriptor</title>

        <para>The descriptor has 2 main sections:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>General application configuration</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Web-specific configuration</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Sip-specific configuration</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <section>
          <title>General Application Configuration</title>

          <para>The application section describes the
          <envar>RAILS_ROOT</envar> and <envar>RAILS_ENV</envar> for the
          deployed application. Under traditional (mongrel, lighttpd)
          deployments, this information is picked up through the current
          working directory or environment variables. Since the TorqueBox
          Server runs from a different location, the current working directory
          has no meaning. Likewise, as multiple applications may be deployed
          within a single TorqueBox Server, a single global environment
          variable to set <envar>$RAILS_ENV</envar> is nonsensical.</para>

          <para><example>
              <title>Application configuration in *-rails.yml</title>

              <para><screen>application:
  RAILS_ROOT: /path/to/myapp
  RAILS_ENV:  development</screen></para>
            </example></para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Web-specific configuration</title>

          <para>Traditional Rails applications are deployed individually,
          without respect to hostnames or context-path. Running under
          TorqueBox, you may host several apps under a single host, or
          multiple apps under different hostnames.</para>

          <para>Both the virtual-host and context-path configuration are
          nested under the <emphasis>web</emphasis> section.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Virtual Hosts</title>

            <para>Virtual hosts allow one application to respond to
            <emphasis>www.host-one.com</emphasis>, while another running
            within the same JBoss AS to respond to
            <emphasis>www.host-two.com</emphasis>. If no host is specified,
            then the application will respond to all requests directed at the
            TorqueBox Server.</para>

            <para><example>
                <title>Virtual host configuration in *-rails.yml</title>

                <para><screen>web:
  host: www.host-one.com</screen></para>
              </example></para>
          </section>

          <section>
            <title>Context paths</title>

            <para>In addition to virtual hosts, applications within a single
            TorqueBox Server may be separated purely by a <emphasis>context
            path</emphasis>. For a given host, the context path is the prefix
            used to access the application. Traditional Rails apps respond
            from the top of a site. By using a context path, you can mount
            applications at a location under the root.</para>

            <para>For example, <emphasis
            role="bold">http://www.host-one.com/app-one/</emphasis> could
            point to one application, while <emphasis
            role="bold">http://www.host-one.com/app-two/</emphasis> could
            point to another separate application.</para>

            <para><example>
                <title>Context path configuration in *-rails.yml</title>

                <para><screen>web:
  context: /app-one</screen></para>
              </example></para>

            <para>The context path and virtual host configurations can be used
            at the same time, if desired.</para>

            <para><example>
                <title>Virtual host with context path configuration in
                *-rails.ymls</title>

      <title>Deployment using a partial descriptor</title>

      <para>While the
      <filename><replaceable>myapp</replaceable>-rails.yml</filename>
      descriptor may contain all the abovementioned information, you may also
      deploy using a combination of descriptor and additional files in your
      <filename>config/</filename> directory. The bare minimum required in the
      descriptor is the <varname>RAILS_ROOT</varname> setting for the
      <code>application:</code> block.</para>

      <para>The primary purpose is to allow an application to be fully
      self-contained, specifying all vital production information within the
      same codebase as the rest of the application. This is useful for
      Capistrano-based deployments.</para>

      <section>
        <title><filename>config/web.yml</filename></title>

        <para>The entire <code>web:</code> section of
        <filename><replaceable>myapp</replaceable>-rails.yml</filename> may be
        supplied from within the application's own
        <filename>config/web.yml</filename> file, if present. If both
        <filename><replaceable>myapp</replaceable>-rails.yml</filename> and
        <filename>config/web.yml</filename> exist, the
        <filename><replaceable>myapp</replaceable>-rails.yml</filename>
        configuration values take precedent.</para>

        <para>This allows for typical values to be placed in
        <filename>config/web.yml</filename> for production deployment, while
        allowing developers to override them through
        <filename><replaceable>myapp</replaceable>-rails.yml</filename> during
        development deployments.</para>

        <para><example>
            <title><filename>config/web.yml</filename></title>

            <para><screen>host: torquebox.org
context: /</screen></para>
          </example></para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title><filename>config/rails-env.yml</filename></title>

        <para>If present in your application, config/rails-env.yml can specify
        the default value for <varname>RAILS_ENV</varname>. A value specified
        in myapp-rails.yml deployment descriptor may still override the value
        provided by the application's own
        <filename>config/rails-env.yml</filename>.</para>

        <para><example>
            <title>Example <filename>config/rails-env.yml</filename></title>

            <para><screen>RAILS_ENV: production</screen></para>
          </example></para>

        <para>Similar to config/web.yml, usage of config/rails-env.yml can
        simplify production deployment by providing the correct value from
        within the app.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Control thread concurrency using
    <filename>pooling.yml</filename></title>

    <para>Since the TorqueBox platform supports Rails 2.2+, which are
    threadsafe, the default mode of operation is to share a single Ruby
    runtime across threads.</para>

    <para>If your application is not designed to be threadsafe, you can
    instead pool the runtimes allowing a single-theaded model. Typically, if
    your application creates and uses global variables to manage state for a
    single request, you may have problems with the default multithreaded
    behavior.</para>

    <para>To enable pooling-mode instead of shared multithreading you need to
    add a YAML file at
    <filename><envar>$RAILS_ROOT</envar>/config/pooling.yml</filename>. This
    file is optional, and only required if you wish to enable pooling.</para>

    <para>This file contains a section for each configurable pool of
    runtimes.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Pooling for web requests</title>

      <para>A section named web defines the pooling configuration for all
      regular web requests. This does not include SOAP endpoints. SIP requests
      do participate in the web pool, though.</para>

      <para>Web pooling is defined by creating a section named
      <classname>web</classname>, and specifying <parameter>min</parameter>
      and <parameter>max</parameter> parameters for the pool. The minimum
      number of runtimes will be created before your application starts. As
      the available items in the pool are exhausted, new ones will be
      asynchronously created, up to the maximum specified.</para>

      <para>Currently there is no reaping performed on the pool reduce its
      size.</para>
